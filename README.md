# schneider-green-world
Schneider Green World is a solution created by me and my group for FIAP x Schneider's challenge at my university. We developed a website using JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to exhibit our solution to Schneider Electric's problem proposal: Sustainability uppon their employees. We also created an app with Python which applies our solution.
