# <b>Schneider Green World</b>
Schneider Green World is a solution created by me and my group for FIAP x Schneider's challenge at my university. We developed a website using JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS to exhibit our solution to Schneider Electric's problem proposal: Sustainability uppon their employees and ways to make them interact more with the enterprise's culture as well as having a bigger sustainable development. We also created an app with Python which applies our idea and the employees will access Schneider Green World through it.
